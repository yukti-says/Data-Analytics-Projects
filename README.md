Welcome to my Data Analytics project folder!
Here, you'll find a collection of real-world datasets Iâ€™ve analyzed using tools like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, Excel, and SQL.
Each project is designed to extract insights, build visualizations, and tell meaningful stories through data.
